          Some people experience their dojos fizzle out and people stop coming after a few times. We don&rsquo;t think this is because people find the dojo unhelpful or that they don&rsquo;t need it. Like any community there needs to be a core of more committed people who turn up to every meeting.
The ParisDojo made a rule that if a meeting was arranged, and noone came, then that was the last meeting.

          If I want to learn Judo, I will enroll at the nearest dojo, and show up for one hour every week for the next two years, at the end of which I may opt for a more assiduous course of study to progress in the art. Years of further training might be rewarded with a black belt, which is merely the sign of ascent to a different stage of learning. No master ever stops learning.

It is a design training place, where it is acknowledged that &ldquo;the code is the design&rdquo; and that code without tests simply doesn&rsquo;t exist.

          Write Your Code and Tests in a Browser! A while ago I ( JonJagger ) attended several coding dojos. I enjoyed them but noticed it often took a long time to install the necessary compilers onto some of the laptops. It occurred to me that it should be possible to run a code-dojo entirely within a browser - write your code and tests inside a simple web-based editor, submit everything to the server whenever you like, the server would run your tests for you and return the outcome - green if they all passed, red if some failed, yellow if there was a syntax error.

          When Dave Thomas introduced the idea of code katas it was in the context that in order to get better at something, you need to practice. Raw talent only gets you so far. Various theories of learning (particularly those proposed by Dr K. Anders Ericsson) suggest that DeliberatePractice over a long period of time is at the heart of attaining expertise.
DeliberatePractice is not the same as experience gained while doing your job.

helping the group to decide what to do at the meeting introducing a totally new Kata exercise to be solved by the group. solving a Kata infront of the group ( PreparedKata ) stepping up to the keyboard and contributing part of the solution to a RandoriKata pointing out smells, code duplication, possible refactorings etc to whoever is typing (on a green bar) asking for explanation and clarification from whoever has the keyboard.

          When I first talked to LaurentBossavit about the ParisDojo , he had an idea about writing a book about it that would help people to set up a regular dojo. The book would be small, light and easy to read, pragmatic and helpful. I am attracted by the idea of having something in print that would be relatively static and authoratative, as a complement to the more interactive material this wiki.

If the pair at the keyboard are not saying anything, ask them to explain what they are trying to do. Identify side track discussions and ask them to be shelved/parked.

Philippe, the FloripaDojo is getting self-organized now, so I can tell you there&rsquo;s a clear distinction between the roles (i. e. organizers are involved before/after the sessions and attendee contributes only during the sessions).

The pair write and implement N tests, where N is usually between 1 and 3. The person who has been at the keyboard longest sits down in the audience and another person takes their place. Does this actually work? I havn&rsquo;t tried it myself but I heard someone describing it.

          Begin each meeting with an introduction to the format and intended aims of the dojo, ie go through WhatIsCodingDojo and/or DojoRules . Tell people when and how they are expected to contribute. Will it be a PreparedKata ? A RandoriKata ? Explain the Kata you will be trying to solve. Perhaps show the description from the entry in the KataCatalogue . If you are not planning to StartFromScratch , go through the pre-existing code.

          an (anti-pattern, is it one?) mechanism for switching the pair at the keyboard when doing RandoriKata
the pair is driving, looking for a solution anyone in the audience may interrupt if he knows the solution the interrupter takes over driving, the driver becomes co-pilot In my experience, this mechanism is an anti-pattern.
Mine too, I have seen this grind a dojo to a halt as people haul the design back and forth in competing directions.

          [TestDrivenDevelopment](/TestDrivenDevelopment) is a way of working, or a process for writing code. You work is paced in BabySteps and your progress is assured by frequently writing and running automated tests. Coding proceeds in an extremely focused and productive rhythm:
1. Write a test for a new function. The test should fail.
2. Write code until the test passes.
3. Refactor until the code is suitable for continued development
4. Goto 1.

        <div class="content">
          A mechanism for switching the pair at the keyboard when doing a RandoriKata
Each pair has a small (5 or 7 minutes) timebox. At the end of the timebox, the driver goes back to the audience, the copilot becomes driver and one of the audience step up to be copilot. You can use a kitchen timer/mobile phone that beeps to remind people when time is up.

          Definition A Coding Dojo is a meeting where a bunch of coders get together to work on a programming challenge. They are there to have fun and to engage in DeliberatePractice in order to improve their skills.
The ParisDojo focuses on coding in front of others, most often something from scratch, in a very short amount of time (1 to 1.5 hours). They use various languages, various tools, various exercise formats.

          ### General How about the ability to actually do a code-dojo without requiring any software (except a browser) installed on the computers of players who want to do a coding-dojo? I have built a free, no-advert code-dojo server to do just this as a service to the software community. It&rsquo;s called CyberDojo . Its url is http://www.cyber-dojo.com I&rsquo;ve also put a screencast demonstrating me doing the KataRomanNumerals in Ruby on vimeo at http://vimeo.
